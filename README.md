ArduinoTherm
============

Using an arduino as a home thermostat.

My ultimate goal of the project is to control my home's furnace using an arduino unit.  This by itself is rather simple,
but I would like to control the arduino using an http interface from a computer that is capable of more logic and
storing additional fields (schedules, runtimes, etc). This computer would also have its own interface most likely
done using ASP.NET but that has yet to be determined.
